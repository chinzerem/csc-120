# CSC-120
The purpose of this repository is to store any projects, labs, or other assignments I have completed in the course, CSC 120, at Bunker Hill Community College during the fall semester of 2020.

The course, CSC 120, is an introductory computer science course. The course is taught using the C++ programming language. All programs were written using Visual Studio Community 2019.

You will find sample (exe) files provided by the instructor (H. Delta) in the folder with each individual tab.
